# dom-manipulation-dojo

In this dojo you can practice DOM manipulation and event handling.

1. Form rows
Open form_rows.html and form_rows.js. Using this skeleton code, create a JavaScript application where I can click on the "Add row" button, and then a new row appears same as the original (has label and input field), plus it has a "Remove" button at the end of the row. Clicking the "Remove" button removes that row. Make sure that at least 10 rows are displayed (when the user wants to add more, we inform her that she cannot do that)

2. Random grid
Open random_grid.html and random_grid2.js. Using this skeleton code, create a JavaScript application where there is a 10x10 grid of div elements, and in every half seconds one of the cells changes it's color (using the .active class). The grid should be generated with JavaScript (you can use the .cell class for a cell div).

3. Move square
Open move_square.html and move_square.js. Using this skeleton code create a JavaScript application where there is a 10x10 grid of div elements and I can click on any of the cells. Clicking one of the cells changes it's color and after that I can "move" the cells with keyboard arrows (e.g. when I press up, then the current cell will be inactive and the cell above it becomes active - if I press the key when the square is on the edge then nothing's happen.
